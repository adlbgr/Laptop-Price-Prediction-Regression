This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features and specifications using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about different laptop models, their configurations, and corresponding prices.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict laptop prices based on their specifications.

Data Exploration: Analyzed correlations between laptop features and prices. Feature Engineering: Created new features like 'TouchScreen' and 'IPS Display'.

Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted data types, and cleaned the dataset. Model Building: Employed regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Random Forest Regressor using GridSearchCV.
